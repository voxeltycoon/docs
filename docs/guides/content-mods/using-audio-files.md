# Using audio files

There's are two audio formats supported by content mods: `.wav` and `.ogg`.

Usually, you should prefer using `.wav` files. They are uncompressed and do not require extra processing to be played.

Using `.ogg` files makes sense only for very long tracks like soundtrack or long-running biome ambient sounds, where its uncompressed size can become an issue.
